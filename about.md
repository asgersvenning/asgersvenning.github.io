Hey, this is my personal website used to document my academic journey and achievements, as well as some somewhat related posts. 

I am a PhD student at the department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University with a project focused on automated and scalable biodiversity monitoring. My research is meant to be broadly applicable, but has a strong focus on insects üêõ and moths ü¶ã in particular. In collaboration with my supervisor Toke T. H√∏je, our research group and many excellent collaborators, we develop machine learning (~AI ü§ñ) models, pipelines and associated hardware to capture, count and identify insects and moths on images. 

I also have a B.Sc. and half M.Sc. in biology from Aarhus University, in which I specialized in computational and statistical ecology and bioinformatics. I did my bachelors on the functional ecology of trees in the United States using the massive FIA dataset, and have done projects related to animal behavior using traditional GPS-collar data and statistical methods as well as historic population analysis using the **A**ncestral **R**ecombination **G**raph (ARG) and **S**equential **M**arkovian **C**oalescent (SMC) framework.
